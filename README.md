# Event booking app

## Description

Avanture.com is my dynamic event management web application, seamlessly blending Angular for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend, ensuring a user-friendly event exploration experience. The darkslatergray navigation bar showcases the brand "Avanture.com," while the responsive toggle button facilitates easy navigation. The search functionality offers real-time event results, dynamically linked to the MySQL database. Event cards present key details, including images, names, locations, descriptions, and dates, with interactive elements for editing, deleting, and commenting. The "Dodaj dogaÄ‘aj!" button triggers a modal for adding new adventures, and efficient event management is made possible by modals for updating and deleting events. The inclusion of a comments section beneath each event card improves community engagement. The technology stack includes Angular for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and Bootstrap for styling, with database integration relying on MySQL.

### Running the project

To run the Spring Boot backend, use ./mvnw spring-boot:run (if using Maven) or ./gradlew bootRun (if using Gradle). For the Angular frontend, initiate with ng serve. Ensure proper configuration of the MySQL database connection based on application requirements.
